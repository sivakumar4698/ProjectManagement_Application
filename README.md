# Project Management Application 


## Technologies used

ReactJS acts as the front end for the application.

MongoDB is the database which is used to fetch and update data when a graphql query or mutation is performed.

Im not new to ReactJS and mongoDB, but I was new to graphql. Thanks to Brad Traversy for developing a course that helped me combine all these together.

### GraphQL

As we know Graphql is gaining popularity within the development community.
I wanted to learn and use graphql, handsdown on of the simplest ways to interact and perform queries.

I'm familiar with MERN stack, I'm used to creating routes using nodeJs, and hit the routes using react fetch or even axios. After learning Graphql, everything seems so simple and easy. I learned about the queries and mutations, the cache feature to make queries seems interesting to use as well. Cause you are not ultimately making a query again. You will just be using it from the cache which is good for the application's health. Also had fun learning and developing graphql schema that specifies all the fields as well as their types.

The Apollo client provides a perfect framework for making react interact with graphql endpoint. Apollo Client is a pretty decent state management library, I was able to manage application data while automatically updating the UI. Which is pretty cool : ). I had to use Redux before for managing the application state, which is also a import skill for any developer but apollo client makes life easier. 

I faced a few problems while performing the query and mutation using Appolo client in the front-end, but it was my lack of knowledge that made it seem difficult. But once you get used to it, you get to know that graphQL is a perfect alternative for REST APIs.

This single endpoint is quite interesting, and apollo client on top of it makes things more easier.

Over All I had fun learning graphQL, the application runs perfectly.

## Key Features

- Add clients to the application
- Add projects to the application
- Assign projects to clients
- Update project details
- delete clients and projects
- Setting up the project status

## How to Run the application.

If you want to run the application. 

Install the dependencies just to be sure. Run - npm install (In root directory as well as in client directory)

You will have to run it for server and the client.

Once done, In the root directory use the command - npm run dev (this will run the graphql server)

After that, cd  into the client directory. 

Now run - npm start (this will get the react app up and running) 

Im putting up my project in public so the job recruiters know about my projects and skill sets. So, please dont add any data or modify the existing data.

If you have any questions feel free to ask.
